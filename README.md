# Data Science Mini Projects

This repository contains two beginner-friendly data science projects built with Python and Jupyter Notebook. Both projects demonstrate how to clean data, analyze patterns, and apply basic machine learning techniques for prediction.

# ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Weather Data Analysis and Prediction

Objective:
Analyze historical weather data and predict future temperature trends.

Key Tasks:
Load and preprocess weather dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots (temperature, humidity, rainfall trends)
Visualize seasonal and yearly weather changes
Build a simple regression model to predict future temperature values

Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

How to Run:
Open Weather.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Install requirements:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Run all cells sequentially

# ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Stock Price Predictor

Objective:
Predict stock price movements based on historical stock market data.

Key Tasks:
Import and preprocess stock price data (Date, Open, Close, High, Low, Volume)
Perform exploratory data analysis with line plots and moving averages
Apply regression models (Linear Regression / LSTM for time series)
Predict closing prices for upcoming days

Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, yfinance (for stock data)

How to Run:
Open Stock_Price_Predictor.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Install requirements:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn yfinance

Run all cells sequentially
